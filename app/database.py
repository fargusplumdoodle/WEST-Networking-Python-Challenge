"""
This is the in-memory database.

Because its in-memory, it can be modified, but it will be reset to this
state after the server restarts.

Normally you would use a real database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.

But if you are here before level 4, you can just manually add
more users/bricks.

🧠 Level 4:
     If you have got through level 3, you can implement a persistent database.
     You can modify this so instead of having a dictionary, it reads/writes
     to/from a JSON file.
